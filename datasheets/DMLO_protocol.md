##  Dim Light Melatonin Onset Study Protocol 

### Background  
The assessment of circadian phase based on the timing of the increase in melatonin secretion in dim light is the gold-standard method for phenotyping the human central circadian pacemaker. In this test, melatonin is measured in saliva samples collected over a period of 8 hours around habitual bedtime in dim light conditions (<10 lux). 

### Materials  

####  Materials to maintain dim light: 
* Blackout blinds, aluminium foil and masking tape
* Luminometer
* Light sensor on Axivity watch and Somnofy
* Dark goggles
* Night lights
* Measuring tape

#### Saliva sample collection  
* Labelled cryotubes
* Straws in ziplock bag
* Spare unlabelled cryotubes, labels and marker pen
* Waste collection bags
* Instruction and log booklet
* Timer
* Tissues
* Cooler box

#### Comparative Instruments
* Axivity watch
* Somnofy device
* Sleep diary

#### Postage material  
* Labelled shipping box
* Packing tape


### Methods  
Samples will be collected hourly starting 6 hours before usual bedtime and completing 2 hours after for a total of 9 samples per DLMO test. Participants are required to remained in dim light (< 5 lux, at level of the eyes, in direction of gaze) starting 6.5 h before their usual bedtime. 
The test begins with 30 minutes in dim light followed by collection of a saliva sample 6 hours before usual bedtime followed by sequential samples every 60 minutes until the last sample taken at 2 hours after the usual bedtime. 
Toothpaste or mouthwash are not allowed during the test, but small snacks and fluids are permitted, except in the 10 min before each sample. Participants were required to rinse with water 10 min before each sample after food or drink.
Participants will be given a checklist of tasks that must be completed as well as the telephone number of a staff member to call if any questions arise during the test.

#### Definition and Maintenance of Dim Light (< 5 lux at eye level)  
A dim light home environment will be established by closing all blinds and curtains, using blackout blinds if necessary. All indoor lights will be dimmed to their lowest settings, or where this is not possible, switched off and replaced with supplied night lights. Light switches will be taped to prevent accidental light exposure. Participants can use electronic devices like smartphones or laptops during the collection as long as (i) the devices are on the lowest brightness setting, (ii) set to night mode if available, (iii) and at least 60cm from their face, as previously described.[1] Light emission from screens will be checked by the participant using the light meter provided and will not exceed 5 lux detected at eye level at 60 cm from the device. Dark goggles must be worn if it is absolutely essential to leave the dim-lit area. Nightlights that emit less than 5 lux light levels at 60 cms above centre will be supplied.
The light sensor on the Somnofy and an Axivity puck worn around the neck will monitor compliance. Participants will be warned that exposure to any light can be detected and will require the study to be repeated.

####  Collection of saliva samples  
Participants will be instructed to allow saliva to collect in their mouths and then drool (not spit to avoid foaming of saliva) through the straw into the labelled tube for that time point. Saliva should be collected to the point indicated on the cryotube (500ul). The pre-labelled tube is re-capped and returned to the cooler box after collection. Participants will receive a logbook to record time and notes about each sample. A timer pre-set to notify every 60 minutes after test commencement will be supplied to aid compliance. Samples will be collected hourly starting 6 hours before habitual bedtime and completing 2 hours after habitual bedtime for a total of 9 samples per DLMO test.

####  End of Test  
Pre-labelled sample tubes will be supplied in a benchtop cooler. After each collection the tube will be replaced in the box and after the final sample, the sample box is placed in a freezer. The morning after the test, the box will be returned to MU by collection or drop off, according to the participant’s wishes.

####  Processing of submitted saliva samples  
When the samples are taken to the laboratory at MU, the tube labels are inspected for integrity and given an additional sequential ID number using a permanent marker that relates to studyID and timepoint and that is recorded in a log book. This second identification measure will protect against data loss if the original label is lost. The tubes will be centrifuged briefly to spin down the sample before freezing at -20oC. When 200 samples have been accrued, the samples will be shipped on dry ice for delivery to Novolytix for measurement of melatonin concentration by radioimmunoassay.

####  DLMO Quality Control  
The DLMO test will be invalid if the participant is exposed to light at intensity greater than 10 lux for more than one minute at any point during the test, or if there are less than 5 samples collected, or less than 3 samples over the predicted time of DLMO. Saliva samples that are less than 200ul will be invalid. The test will be invalid if the Somnofy device or Axivity watch are not collecting movement data during and for 2 weeks prior to the DLMO. The test will be invalid if the sleep diary is not completed for 1 week prior to and after the test day. The test will be invalid if the Axivity watch and samples are not returned by the participant.

####  Melatonin Analysis  
The concentration of melatonin in saliva will be measured by radioimmunoassay by Novolytix.[2]

#### DMLO Calculations  
Salivary DLMO times will be calculated using the hockeystick method.[3]
